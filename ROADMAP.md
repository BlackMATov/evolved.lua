# Roadmap

## Backlog

- validate operation sources in the debug mode
- should set/assign/insert return a constructed component?
- can we pass systems and groups to the process function?
- builders should be rewritten :/

## After first release

- cached queries
- multi-phase groups
- multi-group systems
- observers and events
- add INDEX fragment trait
- add REQUIRES fragment trait
- use compact prefix-tree for chunks
- optional ffi component storages
- keep entity_chunks/places tables as arrays
- batch deferred set/assign/insert/remove operations
