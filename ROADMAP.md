# Roadmap

## Backlog

- add auto chunk count reducing
- optimize batch operations for cases with moving entities to empty chunks
- should we clear chunk's components by on_insert tag callback?
- replace id type aliases with separated types to hide implementation details
- clear chunk's tables instead reallocating them
- add REQUIRES fragment trait
- try to keep entity_chunks/places tables as arrays
- set/assign/insert/remove/destroy for lists?
- add attach/detach functions?
