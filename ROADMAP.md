# Roadmap

## Backlog

- should set/assign/insert return a constructed component?
- add types to every __lua_select call
- chunk(...) check for 0 fragments

## After first release

- add system groups
- add INDEX fragment trait
- add REQUIRES fragment trait
- use compact prefix-tree for chunks
- optional ffi component storages
- keep entity_chunks/places tables as arrays
- batch deferred set/assign/insert/remove operations
